# Brainstorming ideas 

Track 1: Minimizing Screen Time
"Step Away" App: An app that uses Bluetooth or NFC tags around the home to encourage screen breaks. When users tap their phone to a tag (e.g., in the kitchen, by the door, near workout equipment), they earn points. Points can be redeemed for rewards like audio-only guided workouts, mindfulness exercises, or printable activity sheets for kids.

"Social Hour" App: An app that detects when multiple phones are near each other (using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) and sends gentle reminders to reduce screen time and engage with those around them. The app can suggest conversation starters, group activities, or team-based challenges (e.g., trivia, charades) to promote real-world interactions.

Track 2: UIC Student Themed Application
"Study Spotter" App: A real-time map of available study spaces on campus. Students can check in and out of study spots (libraries, lounges, empty classrooms), and the app uses data structures to maintain a priority queue of open spots based on preferences (quiet, group-friendly, near food, etc.).

"UIC Connect" App: A platform that connects students with similar class schedules to form study groups, carpool, or grab lunch together. The app could implement a graph data structure where nodes represent students, and edges represent shared interests or schedule overlaps, helping to build connections and community.

Track 3: Culturally Relevant App Design
"Heritage Stories" App: An app where elders in a community can record and share cultural stories, traditions, and histories. Younger generations can browse by topic or storyteller, creating a digital archive of oral histories. This app could use a trie data structure for efficient searching of stories by keywords.

"Cultural Recipe Explorer" App: An app focused on preserving traditional recipes from a specific culture. Users can input recipes, including historical or cultural context, and the app can recommend dishes based on available ingredients. A tree data structure could be used to categorize recipes by type, region, or ingredient.

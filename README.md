# ✨ Nostalgia Threads 🧵🤎  
*A space to share and connect through cultural memories.*


## About the Project ✍️ 
Nostalgia Threads is a social web platform designed to let users could share short, emotionally resonant stories tied to region, culture, or identity. Think of it as a digital memory lane - filled with stories, snippets, and shared experiences.


## Project Status and Personal Note 📝 😊 
Nostalgia Threads was born out of a shared desire to build a space where people could share short, culture-rooted memories, and emotionally connect across communities. 
I came up with the original idea, mapped out the tech stack, and designed the early system architecture - including building the initial database structure.

The first version of the project was developed in a team setting, but I'm currently working on refining and evolving it into something more aligned with my creative vision. From redesigning the UI to expanding features, this is an ongoing passion project that I'm actively rebuilding and reimagining. <insert thought emoji here>


## Core Features 🛠️ 

- Users can post short text-based memories (max 500 characters)
- Each memory is tagged with a region and optional hashtags
- Reactions feature allows users to respond with emojis
- Memories are stored in a **priority queue** to show the most-reacted ones first
- Tag search and region based filtering powered by a **Trie data structure**.
- Responsive UI with modals for posting and account access.
- **JWT-based authentication** and **session flow**.
